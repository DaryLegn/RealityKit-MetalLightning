# RealityKit-MetalLightning

Technology Stack: Leveraging the power of SwiftUI, RealityKit, ARKit, and Metal, our app is powered by cutting-edge technologies to deliver a rich and immersive augmented reality (AR) experience.

User Interface Flow:

1. Model Selection: The first screen serves as a gateway to our AR world, presenting users with a list of available models. This intuitive interface allows users to browse and select their desired AR model.
2. AR Model Placement: Transitioning to the second screen, users enter an engaging AR environment with a live ARView where their chosen model comes to life. The AR model placement is seamlessly orchestrated by RealityKit, while ARKit handles surface detection for a realistic placement experience.

Visual Enhancement:

Our app takes it a step further by incorporating a custom view modifier that adds a captivating shader-based lighting effect. This shader effect breathes life into the AR view, simulating real-world lighting to elevate the visual aesthetics of the augmented reality experience.
